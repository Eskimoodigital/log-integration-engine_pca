# Aviatrix Log Integration Engine

Flexible and Scalable log integration between Aviatrix and 3rd party SIEM, Logging and Observability tools.

  

The integration is built on top of Logstash with an Aviatrix validated log parsing configuration.  The engine is community supported.

  

The logging engine is deployed as a set of VM instances alongside the existing Aviatrix Control plane. The framework provides example configurations for 2 components:

  

1. Terraform to deploy the cloud infrastructure (Compute with Logstash, Logstash configuration in an object store (S3) bucket, and optionally load balancers) to point Aviatrix logging to and then forward it to the observability platform.

2. Example Logstash configurations based on the Aviatrix CoPilot validated configurations to parse Aviatrix syslog and forward to destinations.



## Deployment Architectures
Currently, the following engine deployment architectures are published in the `deployment-tf` folder:
| Deployment Architecture | Description | README |
|--|--|--|
|aws-ec2-autoscale  | An highly-available autoscaling set of EC2 instances running Logstash behind an AWS NLB with a public Elastic IP. An S3 bucket contains the Logstash configuration and roles are created to allow the VMs to pull the logstash configuration. When the logstash configuration changes, and the terraform is re-applied, the instances will automatically refresh with the new configuration via a rolling upgrade. | [README](./deployment-tf/aws-ec2-autoscale/) |
|aws-ec2-single-instance| A single EC2 instance with Logstash and a public Elastic IP. An S3 bucket contains the Logstash configuration and roles are created to allow the VM to pull the Logstash configuration. When the Logstash configuration changes, and the Terraform is re-applied, the instances will automatically refresh with the new configuration via a rolling upgrade.| [README](./deployment-tf/aws-ec2-autoscale/) |

## Observability Destinations
Currently, the following destination observability outputs are published:

| Destination | Description | README |
|--|--|--|
| output_azure_init | Outputs JSON formatted logs to Azure Analytics Workspace | [README](./logstash-configs/output_azure_init/) |

  
If modifying the Logstash configurations, it is recommended to modify only the "output" section as the inputs will be continuously updated to maintain compatibility with Aviatrix logs.
